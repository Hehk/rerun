# ReRun

An application created to optimize my running behavior. This is currently under heavy development and much of it is held up with ducktape and chewing gum.

## Why

I got heavily into running recently and this has a potential to help me with my growth. I also wanted to play around
with reasonml.

## MVC checklist

- [ ]  Create Run list
- [ ]  Add upload for run data
- [ ]  Add graphql intergration
- [ ]  Parse run data and push to server
- [ ]  Update run data based on server
- [ ]  Add users functionality
- [ ]  Create summaries of run data

## Future plans

- [ ]  Parse data on server side to create more indepth insights
- [ ]  Add react native version
- [ ]  Add a nueral nets to parse data and find new patterns
- [ ]  figure out more ways to fill my free time
